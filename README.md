# HeroesOfPolitics
A recreation of HoMM with politicians as heroes and countries as factions.

## TODO

- Start with the free course on udacity. (Courses like that makes it easy to just hit the pedal without not knowing where to look.)
https://www.udacity.com/course/2d-game-development-with-libgdx--ud405


- Get a character to move around any background on double click. (No path yet)
- Make the simplest kind of background.
- Then make a fighting creature appearing on the map.
- Then make a hero object. Make it 
- Then make it possible to attack the creature.
- Create Town-object
- Make it possible to save game


## Finding the hortest path
Look into algorithms.
The gameworld could be represented as a matrix. Every element in the matrix is either empty or containing an object. Every two adjacent empty elements have an edge between them. When an object is removed (pickud op/defeated/etc) check for new edges (adjacent empty element). Find shortest path with BFS. (We would probably like to save shortest path from one element to another and use dynamic programming). Research this further. 

## Choosing framework

We only need something simple and something that is good for 2D.

Java or C# is prefered.

Unity, Godot etc seem to complicated and heavy programs. If I would want to become a game developer it would be nice to learn but such is not the case.

LibGDX seems easy to use, it is Java, works with 2D, not as much drag and drop, not as heavy, and it makes the game available for multiple devices. (This is what we go for)

## Ideas for later

Politicians as heroes. Countries as factions. Spells as real deseases, military attacks summoning animals etc. 

Should be the possibility to make a drinking game out of this.

Should be possible to turn on world news as background music.

## Legal matters
### Can we get sued for copyright for the game idea?

No!

It's possible to get sued for copyright if you take some art or code etc from the game but not for just getting "inspired". There are already a lot of games that are more of a copy and the same goes for DOTA, CS etc.

### Can we get sued for taking pictures from Google? 

Is the case special with pictures of public figures like politicians?

If google uses pictures then so can we perhaps? 

List of objects with possible copyright issues:

- "name" ; "taken from" ; "investigating status (PASS/PASS WITH COMMENT/FAIL)"; "COMMENT"
